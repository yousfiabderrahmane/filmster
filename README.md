- You can search for a movie by it's name, get the single movie details
  (cast, trailer, reviews slider, recommendations that are related to the
  specific movie type ) by clicking the movie card.
- The tv-Shows button in the Search Bar opens another website with
  the same logic but for Tv Shows.
- Pagination is available at the bottom of each page.
- You can toggle between dark and light themes.
- Originally I managed state with UseState hook, nevertheless later in
  the project I extracted the state logic into a reducer which makes
  state management a lot simpler.
- Once I ended developing the main functionalities of the site, I
  implemented React Lazy/Suspense for code splitting and followed Lighthouse recommendation to aim for an extremely improved
  performance scores. The average Lighthouse analyze tool scores now
